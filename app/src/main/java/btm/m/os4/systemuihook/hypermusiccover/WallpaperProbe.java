     * to be scaled UP to that size to keep the GL matrix (built from the same dimensions) honest.
     * It also puts the fade over its own threshold, so the swap is a cut. Measured on the phone
     * that reported it: 1.3s to re-fit the wallpaper, then 38MB twice on every swap.

     * The fix the module shipped first rewrote the wallpaper FILE (fitLockWallpaperToScreen in

     *   - the bitmap the upload gets, fitted to the surface, in screenSized() below;

     * happens at all, which is every phone until someone picks a big picture.

     * every cover entry, and that second push is what covers a restart of this process: the

     * Whether a crossfade at this texture size is affordable, measured rather than assumed.
     *
     * Every frame of the fade goes through reloadTexture(), and that is not a cheap poke: it
     * re-runs the OEM's onSurfaceCreated(), which clears the surface, rebuilds the GL program
     * and re-uploads the WHOLE texture. So the cost of a fade is the texture size times the
     * frame count, and it is paid on the GL thread while the clock is springing next to it.
     *
     * Measured on the device, same phone, same 240ms fade, the only difference being the lock
     * wallpaper's own dimensions:
     *
     *   1200x2608 (= the screen)  12.5MB/frame  8 frames  waited 16x for the upload   fine
     *   1579x3432                 21MB/frame    7 frames  waited 51x                  breaks
     *
     * Breaks how: the GL thread falls far enough behind that the compositor picks up a frame
     * from the middle of onSurfaceCreated() - after glClearColor, before updateMVPMatrix - and
     * that frame is the cover drawn small on black, in a corner. Reported from the device as
     * "a small album cover in the top right, then it switches over", in both directions.
     *
     * So the gate is the ratio to the screen, which is the number the frame budget actually
     * scales with. A lock wallpaper the size of the screen is what ensureLockWallpaper() writes
     * and what this was built for; 1.7x the screen is not, and a hard cut is better than a
     * transition that flashes. Unknown surface size fades, as before - never make the OEM's own
     * behaviour worse over a number we have not read yet.
